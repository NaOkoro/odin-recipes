    <figcaption> The Best Pozole Rojo you wil ever make </figcaption>
    <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican stew made with meat (usually pork, but sometimes chicken), hominy, chile peppers, and various seasonings. It’s traditionally topped with lettuce, cabbage, limes, onions, avocados, and/or radishes. </p>
    <p>Pozole verde is made with a green sauce, while pozole rojo, such as this one, is made with a red sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork: This recipe starts with a pound of boneless pork shoulder, a pound of boneless pork loin, and pork neck bones. The dish requires three different cuts of pork because It's important to have both lean and fatty cuts, according to recipe creator Consuelo Aguilar.</li>
